# mdtoc

One line: *a command-line tool that generates a table of contents from a Markdown file's headings.*

Plumbline: v1.0

## Stack
Python 3 (standard library only). Tested with pytest. CLI exposed as a runnable module `mdtoc` (`python -m mdtoc`). No external runtime dependencies, no browser/UI.

## Commands
- Test: `python -m pytest`
- Run/demo: `python -m mdtoc <file>` (print TOC to stdout) — e.g. `python -m mdtoc README.md`; add `--insert` to write the TOC back into the file
- Shell/OS: Git Bash on Windows — write all Test and Run commands in this dialect
<!-- UI evidence tool: `architect` adds the line `- UI evidence tool: playwright (python)` here only if the spec calls for a browser frontend. -->

## History
Mode: **git**   <!-- git (default) | none -->

- **git** (default): history is the git log — `scaffold` ran `git init` at birth, every change ends in a commit, and there is no separate changelog.
- **none**: no git. History is the dated artifact trail — `docs/decisions/` (the *why*) plus the dated `output/` reports and the blueprint's checkboxes/stamps (the *what & when*). No manual changelog (an agent forgets it). The trade: a full audit trail, but no per-file diffs.

*Why* a non-obvious choice was made always goes to `docs/decisions/`, in either mode.

## Where things live
| Path | Holds |
|------|-------|
| `Planning/specs/` | **Source of truth for behavior** — one `[feature]_spec.md` per feature, inline **Done when:** |
| `Planning/reference/` | Shared definitions specs cite (data models, constants) — fills as specs need it |
| `Planning/blueprints/` | `foreman`'s per-feature build plans |
| `docs/decisions/` | Why a non-obvious choice was made (`[feature]_YYYY-MM-DD.md`, append-only) |
| `output/` | Skill output — `inspector` evidence, etc. |
| `docs/architecture.md` | The as-built system map — written once modules need one |

(Folders are scaffolded empty up front as guide-rails; `docs/architecture.md` is written when modules need a map.)

## Specs
`architect` writes them. The `**Done when:**` format (tagged `[automated]` / `[human-required]`)
is authoritative in the `architect` skill.

## Change rules
Every code/data/structure change picks a path. Each path ends by **recording** the change — a commit in `git` mode; in `none` mode the saved files are the record (plus a decision doc when the change is non-obvious).

**Quick Path** — no files added/removed/renamed (new *test* files excepted — those are
Quick Path), no schema/core-logic change, nothing a future reader needs explained:
1. Write/edit the code  2. Run the test command  3. Commit (`git` mode)

**Full Path** — everything else:
1. Update the spec (if the change reshapes it, run `architect`)  2. Write/edit the code
3. Run the test command  4. Run `inspector` if tracked by a blueprint
5. Update this file's "Where things live" if files moved
6. Write a decision doc to `docs/decisions/` if a non-obvious choice was made
7. Commit (`git` mode)

## How to work here
- Write in plain, clear language.
- Ask clarifying questions before assuming; when unsure, say so.
- The spec is truth — where code and spec disagree, fix one deliberately.

## Skills
`scaffold` (done) → `architect` (spec) → `foreman` → `builder` (code) → `inspector`.
- **blueprint** (`foreman`) — an ordered build plan built for the AI builder: slices of steps,
  one concern each; risky slices flagged `[inspect]` for a mid-slice inspector stop.
- **proof** (`inspector`) — runs the software and captures evidence that each **Done when:**
  item actually holds; judges whether each committed test could actually fail; stamps PASS/FAIL.
  "Done" means *shown* to work, not asserted.

When the project grows, graduating it (split specs into per-feature files, extract a reference
tier, add `docs/architecture.md`) is a manual step for now.
